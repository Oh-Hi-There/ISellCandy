      Remember: This is not a real business! <br />
      All images used as backgrounds are non-copyright images. The image that
      was used on the <a href="../index.html">{Home page}</a> is the current
      logo of Chupa Chups&copy;, the company that actually produces the lolipops
      I am selling. The images used in
      <a href="../business/purchase.html">{Purchase Products}</a><br />
      are images of the actual lolipops I sell. I usually offer many different
      types of candy. Currently, I am only offering lolipops, and no other
      products because my limited time product - Brookside Dark Chocolate&copy;,
      just sold out over the Thanksgiving weekend. Thank you to all the
      customers who brought my candy!
      <br /><br />
      Preferably, I would like to take customers' orders either through the
      google form, or in-person. However, if absolutely necessary, you can
      contact me through Discord (I will not be putting my username and tag here
      for privacy reasons).

      Are you really bored to the point where you want to see my terrible code
      (actually I don't think it's considered code since HTML a markup
      language)? Well your in luck because I have that on GitHub! Click
      <a href="https://github.com/Oh-Hi-There/ISellCandy.git">{this URL}</a> to
      see all of my writing on GitHub! Hooray! <br />
      <br />
      Note: This technically wouldn't be code because last time I checked, HTML
      and CSS are both markup languages, not programming languages. This means
      that this web page isn't really functional, but it works more like a help
      or additional information page. It doesn't do much except redirect and
      show images, so looking at the writing is rather pointless. :>
